Dear Sister,
Always know that you are my family, and the small fact that we come from different mothers doesn’t make you any less of a sister to me!
I have always followed your path and i will be.
I have taken the same decisions as what you took,People may say that iam a buffoon,I never mind because that’s how you are a special person to me.
But now  I can proudly say that you, Mrs.Sunayana Rapolu, a Senior Devops Engineer stood as an Independent women.
I pray that you will reach to much better heights than what you are now, keep inspiring.
Big hugs to you on your special day!
Happy birthday Akka.
